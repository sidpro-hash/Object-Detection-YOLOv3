# Object-Detection-YOLOv3

Object detection using YOLO V3 training using weight and testing the results in the google colaboratory.

![Object Detection Example](https://github.com/sidpro-hash/Object-Detection-YOLOv3/blob/main/object1.png)

### YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection

Here We are Using A Pre-Trained Model So we needs .weight and .cfg files.
Download this files from [https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) and put this into objectdetection directory.

The steps includes:
1. Upload objectdetection directory to drive
2. There is Two Notebooks ObjectDetection(detection from images) and ObjectDetection_v2(detection from real-time & video), Mount to drive.
