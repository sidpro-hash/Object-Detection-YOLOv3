Since the ConvNet outputs square matrices of feature values (i.e something like a 13x13 or 26x26 in case of YOLO) the concept of **\"grid\"** came into the picture.

But this wouldn’t eliminate all, so the next step in the NMS would be implemented, i.e to arrange all the confidences of the bounding boxes in descending order and choose the one with the highest score as the most appropriate one for the object.
